<br>
</ol>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Cut the onions into thin slices. Cut the carrots diagonally while rotating them a quarter turn between cuts (we call this cutting technique <a href=https://www.justonecookbook.com/rangiri/>"rangiri”</a> in Japanese).</li>
            <br>
                <li>Cut the potato in half, and then cut each half into quarters. Soak the pieces in water for 15 minutes to remove the starch.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Clean the mushrooms. (I use a pastry brush and avoid washing mushrooms as they absorb moisture. However, it's okay to quickly rinse them.) Then, cut them into thin slices.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Cut the beef into 1½-inch (3.8 cm) cubes and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then lightly coat the meat with flour.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Cook the beef in 2-4 batches. Preheat a cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add 1 Tbsp oil and 1 Tbsp butter. Next, add the beef cubes in a single layer, making sure not to crowd the skillet; otherwise, the excess moisture in the pan will end up "steaming" the meat. Sear the beef cubes on one side until brown and crusty, about 8-10 minutes, then turn them over (don't touch them until then). The meat will release itself from the pan when the surface is seared nicely. Transfer the seared meat to a plate and work on the next batch.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Preheat a large heavy-bottomed pot on medium heat. When the pot is hot, melt 1 Tbsp butter in the pot and add the onions. Add 1 Tbsp olive oil and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Add the salt and sauté the onions until tender and translucent, about 20 minutes. If you have time, continue sautéing the onions until caramelized, about 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, and tomato paste and sauté for 2 minutes.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Add the beef and wine to the pot and stir for 3 minutes, letting the alcohol evaporate.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms. Add enough of the beef stock (and water, if using) to just cover the ingredients. Cover the pot with a lid and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Once boiling, skim off the scum and fat from the broth. I prepare a 2-cup measuring cup with water in it and clean my fine-mesh skimmer in the water. It’s easy to remove the scum/fat from the skimmer this way.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Add the bay leaves and cover the pot with the tight-fitting lid. Simmer on the lowest heat until the meat is tender, about 2 hours.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Occasionally, skim the broth to clean the scum from the surface. Make sure the ingredients are covered by the broth; if they're not, then add the remaining beef stock (and/or water) to just cover the ingredients.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Once the ingredients are tender, turn off the heat and add the curry roux. Put 1-2 cubes of roux in a ladleful of cooking liquid, slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks, and stir it into the broth to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Adjust the amount of curry roux to your taste. (You may not need to use all the roux; reserve the extra cubes for another use). If the curry is too thick, add water to dilute. From this point, simmer on the lowest heat and stir often. Be careful not to burn the curry!</li>
            <br>
                <li>Add the milk, Worcestershire sauce, and grated apple. Mix thoroughly and simmer until heated through. If the curry sauce is too thin and soupy, uncover the pot and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Serve the curry with Japanese steamed rice and top with fukujinzuke if available.</li>
