    <h2>Better Instant Ramen</h2>
    <p>Confession time: sometimes I actually like instant ramen. You know, those cheap little packets of salty noodles that only cost 30¢? I don’t eat them often, maybe once per year, but when I get the craving I’m totally not above grabbing a packet of instant noodles and going to town. Over the years I’ve found 6 easy ways to upgrade instant ramen, like to the point where it might actually qualify as a legit meal, AND use up the leftovers in my kitchen at the same time. So I’m going to share them with you today because it’s a total win-win.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>tablespoon sesame oil</li>
          <li> 3 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
          <li>4 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
          <li>4 cups broth (I used chicken, but vegetable would also work)</li>
          <li>4 cups water</li>
          <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
          <li>2 packages instant ramen (noodles only!)</li>
          <li>1/2 cup chopped scallions or chives</li>
          </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the garlic and ginger; stir fry for 2 minutes or until soft and fragrant.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add the broth and the water. Bring to a simmer; add the mushrooms and simmer for 10 minutes or until the mushrooms have softened and the broth is flavorful.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add the instant noodles to the hot liquid and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or until the noodles have softened. Add the scallions and stir to combine.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
